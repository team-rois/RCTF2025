### 提示

Welcome to "The Alchemist's Cage." In this forge, you'll challenge a paranoid AI Alchemist to create a Golem from a "soul seed," forging a flawed being sworn to protect a secret. You have only five turns to interrogate your creation, exploit its personality flaw, and coax out the hidden rune it guards. Uncover the secret before the Golem is shattered and its knowledge is lost forever.
